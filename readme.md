Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Description
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python. The game allows the user to play against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options.

How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The game will display ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
3. You will be prompted to enter a choice:
   - Type `0` for Rock
   - Type `1` for Paper
   - Type `2` for Scissors
4. The computer will randomly choose one of the three options.
5. The result will be displayed based on the following rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
   - If both the user and computer select the same option, it's a tie.

Example Output

you have chosen: 1
computer chose 2

Future Enhancements
- Add a loop to allow multiple rounds.
- Improve ASCII art representation.
- Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) version.
- Implement a scoring system.
